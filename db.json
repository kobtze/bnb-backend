Beautiful area in Nob Hill with walkable coffee shops/restaurants, etc. Cable car museum is right next door ( would have loved to go but, pandemic) Inside of the house has plenty of space for a couple or even 2 couples if needed. Super clean and stylish. Hope to stay here again one day!"

Our kiddo loved the coziness of the downstairs bedroom. We researched hotels prior to booking. So glad we stayed here. It really made of feel like an authentic stay in San Fran. What a great experience for our first Air BNB stay!"
