They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival.

At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival.

At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

Our kiddo loved the coziness of the downstairs bedroom. We researched hotels prior to booking. So glad we stayed here. It really made of feel like an authentic stay in San Fran. What a great experience for our first Air BNB stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf94","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4434852","name":"Riad Hadda Chambre Malika","description":"Welcome to Riad Hadda, Restored in the pure Moroccan tradition, the Riad is located in the heart of the ramparts of the Medina, near the Bab Aylen gate, the Royal Golf and a few minutes from the Jemma el Fna square.","type":"Private room","capacity":3,"price":51,"amenities":["Wifi","Dryer","Hair dryer","Breakfast","Hangers","Pool","Heating","Essentials"],"mainImgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/76170179/2a18aef0_original.jpg?im_w=1680","imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/57524083/183d2796_original.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/57510970/f800dfe2_original.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/55713786/ff9f6d90_original.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/91463801/14e3553a_original.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/57524017/8a4a47f2_original.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2a7046ae-912f-477c-bb8a-ebd599a86b40.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h105","name":"Mehdi","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/23023059/profile_pic/1414431305/original.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"Marrakesh, Marrakesh-Tensift-El Haouz, Morocco","lat":31.625031,"lng":-7.99296},"scores":{"cleanliness":4.9,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.9,"value":4.8,"rating":4.84},"reviews":[{"_id":"r401","createdAt":"2019-11-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Nathalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1dd94b58-dfe9-492f-9bee-dbc68a92b738.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"Would come to this riad again and again!!

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

They both are delightful hosts and had so many suggestions for us first timers to NYC. We were given a guide ahead of time of so many things to do, places to see, and places to eat. Check in was super easy and a bit early, which didn’t seem to be a problem at all this particular day. Marc gave a short tutorial showing us how to get in the building and how to use the elevator. It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted. Well, that means we’ll need to come back and we will have this fantastic place to stay!"}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf98","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28426648","name":"Shelter in An Incredible Place.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport.

The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv. Only bad thing was that we didn’t have enough time to see and do all the things we wanted.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan.

Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.

It was great not to have to navigate stairs with suitcases. The apartment was spacious and spotless and we had access to everything we needed. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash already there for us to use was nice. Especially since you don’t have to pack it in your suitcase, which makes it a bit lighter for the airport. We didn’t use the kitchen much as we didn’t want to cook for ourselves, but it seemed to have everything you’d need if you did decide to cook. The internet was great and there were lots of choices for tv streaming services. After a long day of walking outside in the cold, it was nice to get back, curl up on the sofa with lots of pillows, have a nice fire in the fireplace, and watch a little tv.

The kitchen is an efficiency kitchen and really not for cooking but who cooks while in Manhattan. The second bedroom is not a true bedroom - it is where the dining room was and has false walls put up that do not go all the way to the ceiling. Nonetheless it is still a large living room and the master bedroom is spacious. Both bathrooms are great. We needed one extra bed so the host had an air mattress set up for us on arrival. My only complaint was that the host was very hard to get in touch with. At one point I had to have Air BnB reach out to him in order to get a response and was on the verge of cancelling since the unresponsiveness made me very nervous. Now that I am familiar with the host and the space I would honestly rent again because it really is the perfect space for my family of five while staying in the city and you have all the amenities of the hotel - room service, gum, etc."}]},{"_id":"5f14b65f5d25b48cd53abf9a","org-url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38779829","name":"Chic 1 BR , Penn St & Hudson Yards.","description":"Fantastic Central Park view very Luxury 2 BR 2 Bath.n the 5 star building High Floor large windows , excellent light","type":"Entire apartment","capacity":4,"price":67,"amenities":["Wifi","Hair dryer","Dryer","Washer","Laptop-friendly workspace","Cable TV","Essentials","Heating","Paid parking on premises"],"imgUrls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35c87913-a5b0-48c2-9449-5310248cb02e.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8260285-eacf-4396-b912-679964b2db6c.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740a3582-6ac1-4ae0-88a1-a7b2b33703a3.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33e945f6-3700-4b7c-ad2d-d12456c09cce.jpg?im_w=1680","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1131d5e7-7c71-4805-bf77-080b4d037709.jpg?im_w=1680"],"host":{"_id":"h1002","name":"Amalia","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4f0c77c0-8b22-49cd-af79-edd2d14bdce8.jpg?im_w=240"},"location":{"name":"New York, United States","lat":40.754521,"lng":-74.003491},"scores":{"cleanliness":5,"accuracy":4.9,"communication":4.9,"location":4.3,"checkin":4.4,"value":4.2,"rating":4.85},"reviews":[{"_id":"r1001","createdAt":"2020-04-10T05:00:00.000Z","byUser":{"name":"Jay","imgUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1893c98e-6c64-44bd-9e21-ea4dc33e78cf.jpg?im_w=240"},"description":"I had a wonderful stay at Amalia's place.
